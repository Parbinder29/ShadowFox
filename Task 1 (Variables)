#Variable Task 1

pi = 22 / 7
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Data type of pi:", type(pi))


#Variable Task 2

# 1.2 Create a variable named 'for' and assign it 4
# for = 4  # This will show a SyntaxError
# Reason:
# 'for' is a reserved keyword in Python used for loops, hence cannot be used as a variable name.


#Variable Task 3

1P = 1000  # Principal amount
R = 5     # Rate of interest
T = 3     # Time in years

SI = (P * R * T) / 100
print("Simple Interest for 3 years is:", SI)
